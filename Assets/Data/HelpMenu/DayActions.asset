  description: "You can select a character with [LEFT-MOUSE] and deselect them by
    clicking on any point on the map.\r\nDuring the day each of us can either move
    or attack another human; both actions are limited in distance by our range stat.
    Places where the selected character can move are highlighted in yellow, villagers
    the selected character can attack are highlighted in red. To move or attack just
    click on the target you want to hit or move to. \r\nEvery villager can do only
    one action per day. You can end the day at any point by pressing the \u201CEnd
    Day\u201D button in the lower right corner.\r\n"
