  description: "Werewolves are hiding behind the appearance of two of the eight villagers.
    During each night they hunt for human blood. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t see
    what happens during the night. However, during the day we can see who\u2019s
    hurt and try to determine who attacked them. Our goal is to identify the two
    werewolves and kill them during the day, once and for all. "
