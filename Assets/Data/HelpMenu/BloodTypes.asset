  header: BLOOD TYPES AND NIGHT ATTACKS
  description: "The werewolves have preferred blood types based on their own blood
    type: type-O wolves like only type-O blood; type-As like A and O, and type-Bs
    like B and O; type-AB wolves love every type of blood. So, every night, each
    werewolf will attack the closest human with their preferred blood type; if they
    don\u2019t find their favorite blood, they just go for the closest human. Remember
    to also compare the HPs lost by the villagers during the night with the villagers\u2019
    wolf Atk stat: it will be an important clue to understanding which of them are
    the werewolves."
