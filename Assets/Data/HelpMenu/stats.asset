  description: "You can see every character\u2019s stats by hovering over them. The
    range stat specifies the maximum distance of nodes the selected character can
    move to or attack. Each of us has a certain amount of HPs (health points), that
    decreases when we\u2019re attacked by a werewolf or another human. The Atk stat
    describes how hard we hit during the day; the wolf Atk describes the werewolves\u2019
    power in reducing our HPs during the night. "
